# Scanner
A python programme to scan the open port on the host
It is based on python 3.6.3 and use package "socket" and "threading". Also, it use "argparse" to support more command line command. 
## About the command
scan.py host start-end port. It is clear, isn't it?
## Some ideas about the program
I use the "threading" to make the multithreaded programm. And it is my first time to make multithreaded programm. It is interesting and useful.
